  c)learned about iterating through the tree structure(?) of html, parent and child nodes
  d)learned about the syntax and built-ins of javascript and html
 
 4) Regards to assignment #1
   a) ReversedStartups( ) => i started at the end of the array w/ data and filled another array starting at the front, then returned the      new array.
   b) CleanAndCount( ) => iterate through child Nodes, used a regex to replace and trim each string, then counted it after
   c) toggleDisplay( ) => added another boolean variable in flags object for the display options: essentially it has two states dpending on    which state the file is in it will either fill containers with data or an empty string ''.
   d) displayInstructions => assigned the anonmyous function to a var/object and then called it
